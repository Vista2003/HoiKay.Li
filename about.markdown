Just a random blog that I'm running. <br>
There isn't really a focus to this website and I simply write about whatever I’m interested in at the time.
It began with technology, but over time it drifted into other areas that catch my interest and curiosity. <br>

So while this random island on the internet can be a bit random, I hope you enjoy your stay as I leave my tiny mark on the world.
