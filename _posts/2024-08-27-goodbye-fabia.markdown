Today, I say goodbye to my first car, a 2005 Silver Skoda Fabia Mk1. While the decision to buy that car came more from desperation rather than desire, it was a purchase that I did not live to regret. I purchased the car in October 2021 from the (now retired) family mechanic friend for not a lot. At the time, I was still a learner driver after completing around 4 lessons from a few months prior and not much experience behind the wheel. <br>
<br>
The first drive with the Fabia almost ended in disaster when I felt I would crash into a parked lorry in a layby (thankfully it didn’t happen). But we worked from it, through thick and thin, the Fabia was a friend helping me to learn the ropes of driving. <br>
I passed my driving test with my second attempt which was done in the Fabia, rather than the instructor's SUV (top tip, if you can do your driving test in your car rather than the instructor's, do it) and you were there, to celebrate a milestone with me. That milestone marked the start of the fastest-changing period of my life where I managed to pass my test, leave my old job, move to a new place and start my new job in the space of 2 weeks. I honestly don’t know how I would have done it without you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Over the next almost 2 years we clocked nearly 20k miles together as a full licence holder, through snow, ice, rain or shine, you were there for me and now as our time together has drawn to a close, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart, Fabia. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your service and for being there for me. You will be remembered.
