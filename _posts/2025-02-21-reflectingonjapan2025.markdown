description: Reflecting on my Japan trip and the language journey so far

*During my Japan trip, I had a realisation.*

I've been learning Japanese for two years now, currently working my way through the lower-intermediate level. The road ahead remains long, and as we sit in our frustration and isolation, we slowly rediscover what it means to be human.

In a world where we crave instant results, only a lunatic would willingly embark on this journey. Yet, for those who do, it becomes an experience full of contradictions. We learn to connect but often feel more isolated. We break apart our old worldview, only to replace it with something more uncertain—because the more we know, the more we become aware of the unknown.

As I wrap up my Japan trip, I had some time to reflect on my journey. I came to Japan for many reasons but one that stood out was to test myself, to find myself in an environment where I have no easy exits. While I still have a lot to work on with my language abilities, it has shown me why I loved Japan from afar and why continuing with learning the language is worthwhile.

I look back on these three weeks, on everything I’ve experienced—from the snow festival in Sapporo and snowboarding in Niseko, to the billboards of Osaka and the *machiya* of Kyoto, to witnessing and photographing Mount Fuji’s clear peak (photo coming soon™) from the Shinkansen, and finally arriving in Tokyo, where it all began.

Though my trip is ending, I will treasure the memories I’ve made here.

As I take my final steps, my legs nearly giving out from the journey, I limp through the land of the rising sun one last time.

At least for now.

From the bottom of my heart—ありがとう日本、また今度ね。
