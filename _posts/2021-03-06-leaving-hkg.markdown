After a long consideration during my break, I have decided that I no longer wish to continue my role as a member of this group. My reasoning to do so stems from what I have already explained in my statement about temporarily stepping back from my administrative roles, now I believe it’s time to make that permanent.  <br>
My reasoning for leaving is simple, I believe that the “golden era” of this group has passed and that the feeling of the community has gone. Sure, the people are still here but the sense of community has gone also it feels like an echo chamber which seems to be very restrictive on the subjects that can be discussed.
I’ve been considering leaving for the last few months but I stayed to aid with the transition to Signal and since the foundations for it have now been laid. I believe it’s time for me to go.<br>

I’m planning to stick around until Monday and after Monday, I will still be available to be contacted over Signal, Line or Telegram (Signal is preferred) though I will no longer be part of the group.<br>

The bot will stick around for longer and be up until the 13th of March.

I wish you all well moving forward.<br>
Hoi Kay<br>
