# Introduction 
Windows 11 is the first Windows client release since Windows 10 was released in 2015, this is the longest gap between Windows releases since 2007 with the gap between Windows XP and Windows Vista and like the bungled launch of Vista in 2007, I believe that Microsoft is repeating the same mistakes that ruined the Vista launch all those years ago.

# Confusingly system requirements
In 2006, Microsoft started the "Vista Capable" program which allowed OEMs to mark their PCs as "Windows Vista Capable" which meant that the PCs met the system requirements for Vista and it was believed (rightly or wrongly) that owners of 2006 XP machines could upgrade to Vista and have Vista's bells and whistles.

In reality, the Vista Capable sticker only meant that the system met the requirements for Windows Vista Home Basic which lacked the visual wow of Windows Aero and with only 512MB of RAM, Vista would run very slowly.
