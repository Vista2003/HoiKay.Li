# Introduction 
Windows 11 is the first Windows client release since Windows 10 was released in 2015, this is the longest gap between Windows releases since 2007 with the gap between Windows XP and Windows Vista and like the bungled launch of Vista in 2007, I believe that Microsoft is repeating the same mistakes that ruined the Vista launch all those years ago.

# Confusingly system requirements
In 2006, Microsoft started the "Vista Capable" program which allowed OEMs to mark their PCs as "Windows Vista Capable" which meant that the PCs met the system requirements for Vista and it was believed (rightly or wrongly) that owners of 2006 Windows XP machines could upgrade to Vista and have Vista's bells and whistles.

<br>
In reality, the Vista Capable sticker only meant that the system met the requirements for Windows Vista Home Basic which lacked the visual wow of Windows Aero and with only 512MB of RAM, Vista would run very slowly.
<br>
Windows 11's system requirements are very unusally high and a departure from the system requirements for Windows 10 that haven't really changed since Windows Vista (apart from increases to minimum storage and extra CPU instructions). Windows 11 requires a 8th generation Intel CPU (2017) or an AMD Zen+ CPU (2018) with some expections given to some 7th generation Intel CPUs like the Intel Core i7 7820HQ which is in the Surface Studio 2 which Microsoft is selling at full price on their store to this day (as of writing).

When these system requirements were annouced, there was wide spread backlash against it as the decision was seen as very tone deaf as it forced most people to have to replace their perfectly working PC during a chip shortage to get the new expierence.

EXPAND ME!!!
# The last version of Windows was very entrenched 
Windows XP was released almost 6 years before the release of Windows Vista and as such was running on over 70% of the 1.1 billion PCs in 2008, Windows 10 is currently running on over 75% of all Windows PCs which translates to more than 1.3 billion PCs.
