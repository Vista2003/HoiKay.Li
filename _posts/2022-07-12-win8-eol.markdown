Start your end of support countdown clocks for Windows 8.1. Microsoft has now released an end of support popup for Windows 8.1, like what they did for Windows XP and Windows 7 before it. <br>
<br>
As a reminder, Windows 8.1 support ends on the 10th January 2023. For many, this date will go on unnoticed but for some devolt Windows 8.1 users, this day will be sad indeed.
