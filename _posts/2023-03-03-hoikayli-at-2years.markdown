*Wow, it’s been 2 years already? Time surely flies.* <br>
<br>
I started this website back in February 2021, back then I was in my final year of sixth-form college in the UK and a lot has changed since then. Over the last 2 years, a lot has happened, and my life has changed drastically since February 2021. <br>
<br>
When I created this site, I was hoping to post regularly on it but I haven’t been great at doing that. Back then, I hoped to put reviews and tech tips on here but I just haven’t had the time to do it over the last 2 years. I do hope to change that I will be able to post here more often but it does take more effort compared to something like a Reddit post to put something here.<br>
<br>
So, what have I been up to in the past 2 years?
<br>
Well, after finishing sixth-form college, I was hoping to get into a degree apprenticeship in 2021 but I started my search too late and a lot of the good places were already closed by the time I started to apply. In the summer of 2021, as a stopgap, I did a gap year and entered the world of work.
In August 2021, I started work at a system integrator (people who sell custom-built PCs) as an RMA technician. While I liked the people I worked with, the company isn’t great to work with.<br>
<br>
From September 2022 – October 2022, a lot changed in a small space of time. I got my full driving license, moved out of my parent’s place into my own place and moved jobs in the space of only around 2 weeks. I’m currently doing a Degree Apprenticeship in IT Infrastructure. 
Moving forward, I’m hoping to update this blog more than once every few months, but we’ll see. <br>
<br>
Bye for now (≧∇≦)ﾉ
