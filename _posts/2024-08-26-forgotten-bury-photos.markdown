These photos were taken in Bury, Greater Manchester. Bury was once, one of the many indutrial towns in the north of England. Bury was known for its textile industry, until that got shipped overseas, leaving behind the husts of its former glory. These photos were taken on a [Fujifilm X20](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/fujifilm-x20) from 2013.
