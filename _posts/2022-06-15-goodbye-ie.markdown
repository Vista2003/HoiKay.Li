Today marks the end of support for Internet Explorer in most cases. Of course, with it being Microsoft there are expections to this rule with IE still being supported on Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 - 2022, Windows 7 (with ESU), Windows 10 LTSC/LTSB amoung others. But the for majority of Windows users, today marks the end for Internet Explorer.

Internet Explorer has a chequered history, from the browser wars of the 1990’s and the multiple antitrust cases that occurred as a result of it to being the dominant web browser of the early 2000’s to its fall in the 2010’s. This post isn’t about any of that as that story has been told many times and will probably be told many more times in the future. This post instead is about my personal experiences with the browser. <br>

My first experiences with Internet Explorer was sometime in the mid-late 2000's when I was using the family computer on children's websites of the era. The CBeebies website comes to mind with this. At the time, I would spend hours in Flash games on these sites. Sadly that computer broke sometime between 2008 - 2009 and it was time to move onto the next period of my life on Windows Vista.
