Pendle Rise Shopping Centre is a shopping mall in the centre of Nelson, Lancashire, UK. The interior feels like a blast from the 80s/90s and with this look I've decided to use the old Nikon D80 to capture the location. Below are photos take in August 2023 although, like with the previous post at Arcade Club Bury, the photos may feel older due to the sensor used to take these photos.

Come with me as we explore what's left at Pendle Rise.
