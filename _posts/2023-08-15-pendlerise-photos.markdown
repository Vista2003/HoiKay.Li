Pendle Rise Shopping Centre is a shopping mall in the centre of Nelson, Lancashire, UK. The interior feels like a blast from the 80s/90s and with this look I've decided to use the old  [Nikon D80](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond80) to capture the location. The photos below were taken in August 2023 although, like with the previous post at [Arcade Club Bury](https://hoikay.li/photography/2023/08/12/ac-bury-photos/), the photos may feel older due to the sensor used to take these photos. <br>
