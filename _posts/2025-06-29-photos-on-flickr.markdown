Hi all, this is just an announcement to say that I'm now uploading new photos to Flickr as it's an easier place to publish my photos than it is here. This should mean that I'll post my photos more frequently (but no promises)


You can access my Flickr [here](https://flickr.com/people/hoikay/) but before you go, here is a small sample of photos that I have there. I hope you enjoy them.
