The Resurgence group chat started in June 2019 during the height of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The group started as an Instagram story that appeared one day and as soon as I saw it, I jumped on and asked to be added to the group. During the early days of the chat, I can remember the excitement of each morning of getting hundreds and maybe thousands of notifications (yes it was that bad). During the early days, it was the place for me to meet new people and to discuss things. I can still remember the panic of the rumours that tanks would be deployed in Hong Kong. <br>

Anyways, after an incident of backstabbing from one of the first admins and the subsequent paranoia and fallout (circa September 2019), I was promoted to the role of admin in circa October 2019 though discussions of the promotion did occur just before the incident. 
I was an admin between October 2019 to March 2021 and during that time, I mainly handled the community side of the Resurgence which was the group chat (later chats) on WhatsApp and later Signal. I can put the group in 3 main periods that occurred during my time. <br>
1.	New group and the height of the protests
2.	SARS-CoV-2
3.	NSL
<h2> New group era </h2>
This period ran from the start to around December 2019, this was when the group saw new people come in all the time and many of my fond memories came from this period. The chat back then had a Minecraft server (hosted by me) and had many different people with different opinions and characterises. I do believe that the group’s trajectory followed the trajectory of the protests happening in the real world. 

## SARS-CoV-2
The SARS-CoV-2 era started around early January as people noticed a mysterious virus from Wuhan and subsequently gave it nicknames that were referring to it or the leader of the PRC. During this era, discussions switched from protests to this new virus, case numbers, masks, etc. Other things were discussed during this period though the virus and lockdowns in the world seemed to be the main thing on the menu. This era came to a close in mid-2020 with the announcement of the National Security Law in Hong Kong.

## National Security Law
The National Security Law was put into force in June 2020. In the run-up to it, a lot of actions were taken in the attempt to hide the tracks before the new law would have caught up with them. Though many of these attempts were limited in their effectiveness. The start of the law also created what I would call the “Blue Scare” this is in reference to people in the group being afraid of blue people (not really). What it actually meant was that people were afraid of people who were affiliated with the blue side of society who would inform the authorities regarding possible National Security Law violations. Honestly, I don’t know how effective were the screenings done by other admins in the group to detect people who were possibly blue individuals. 
The introduction of the National Security Law greatly impacted the topics that could be discussed in the group and it is created during the height of the protests which at this point have died because of this law made it seem boring in my opinion.

## Why did I leave?
As discussed in my blog post on resignation, the reasons for leaving were the echo chamber and loss of community and here I would like to discuss further. 
### Echo chamber
The echo chamber is where people who enter an environment that would only “echo” back their own opinions i.e. they surround themselves with people who have the same opinions as themselves. This is not a particularly healthy way of going about discussions neither is it intellectually stimulating to anyone. The group after a while started to only discuss things from one point of view and couldn’t for the life of the understand why anyone else could think any way else. I would occasionally show a different opinion if I was well verst in that subject though after a while I found it harder to do so as I felt social pressure (that may not be there) to stay quiet. Maybe I’m over analysing it but that’s how it felt to me.
### Lacking security
Security for accounts relating to HKG and the Resurgence was like a feather holding a door closed with logins that were unaudited, no 2FA of any kind and weak passwords (without disclosing it, one of the account passwords was just a short word with a year on it). Needless to say, that needed to be overhauled but the resistance to adopting account backups and recoveries led to the original HKG account being taken over by the above-mentioned backstabbing admin. \
Slow adoptions to Signal or other secure messengers are also of note as Signal was suggested by me back in June 2019! Yes, it took over a year to get any sort of Signal group chat to get a somewhat sizable adoption rate.
### Lack of action from other admins
Things that were planned such as a website and secure services ultimately fell on deaf ears. The suggestions were put forward and domains were at one point registered but it went nowhere with no support. 
I feel that I was going against a wall when trying to suggest and create additional services for the group which were either ignored or I get no support in any way.




## Suggestions for the leadership 
These are my suggestions for the leadership, whether you take them or not is up to you.
*	Try to foster healthy debate – if everyone seems to agree on a controversial topic you have an echo chamber, there are likely a handful of members who do have a differing opinion but hide them. Allow these to be discussed without dismissing them as stupid or illogical. Allow them to rest their case and keep an open mind.
*	Try to expand to other platforms and support members or admins who bring new ideas forward, don’t let them land on deaf ears and give them the support that they need.
*	Review your security policies as there are still many points of failure.
*	Be less reliant on major platforms and if needed, create your own.
*   Stop just focusing on the numbers and put more focus on your community

## Closing thoughts
I'm grateful for the time and memories that have been forged in the early days and I'm grateful for being selected to be an admin of the Resurgence group. However, with many things my time there has now come to an end. I do hope that the group refinds their roots and bring back the sense of community that was in the early days though I’m pessimistic on if the group can do it in its current state.<br>
I wish you all luck moving forward!
